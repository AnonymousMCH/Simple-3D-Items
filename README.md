# Simple 3D Items
 Simple 3D Items Bored of the simple Minecraft 2D items? This could be the solution to your problem! Try my resourcepack that adds some 3D models to some simple items in Minecraft. If you have alredy tried it and you have an opinion or suggestion, please leave a comment!  This project applies new models and emissive textures (glow in the dark) to some of the minecraft items and soon they will be more! Neat 3D and "realistic ladders", or that's what they say! This resource pack adds some fancy voxel-like 3D models for some of the items in the game, every idea from anyone will be taken into account.     Note: This project is a beta, and IT MAY CONTAIN MAJOR BUGS, fortunately, they dont affect the gameplay or any security-related things. You can report the bugs here in the comments. I work alone, so the resourcepack should have some delay in between its updates.
